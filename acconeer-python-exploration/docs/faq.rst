#) Import errors with NumPy on Linux

   The solution is to remove all duplicates of NumPy and reinstall using pip::

      sudo apt remove python3-numpy
      python -m pip uninstall numpy       # Repeat until no NumPy version is installed
      python -m pip install --user numpy

   Depending on your environment, you might have to replace ``python`` with ``python3`` or ``py``.

#) The GUI does not load properly after updating

   Try removing the ``last_config.npy`` file in the ``gui`` directory.

   If the above does not work, please open an issue on GitHub.
