    # The client logs using the logging module with a logger named
    # acconeer.exptool.*. We call another helper function which sets up
    # the logging according to the verbosity level set in the arguments:

    # Alternatively, start_session can be given the config instead. In
    # that case, the client will call setup_session(config) for you
    # before starting the session. For example:
    # session_info = client.start_session(config)
    # As this will call setup_session in the background, this will also
    # connect if not already connected.

    # In this simple example, we just want to get a couple of sweeps.
    # To get a sweep, call get_next. get_next will block until the sweep
    # is recieved. Some information/metadata is returned together with
    # the data.

    # away. This call will block until the server has confirmed that the
    # session has ended.
    client.stop_session()

    # Calling stop_session before disconnect is not necessary as
    # disconnect will call stop_session if a session is started.
